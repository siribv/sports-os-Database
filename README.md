# Sports OS - Database Layer

## Sports OS Database Layer

The Sports OS Database Layer is developed using **MongoDB**, **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **Mongoose**. It provides a scalable and flexible database for storing sports-related information such as academies, coaches, athletes, sports, and shortlisted academies.

This layer supports **bulk CSV import**, schema validation, and structured collections for easy integration with the Repository Layer and API Layer.
